## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Download and Open Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeWithInferno/I.R.I.S.git
   cd I.R.I.S/LiDARObstacleDetection
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode:**
   - Double-click `LiDARObstacleDetection.xcodeproj`
   - OR right-click ‚Üí Open With ‚Üí Xcode
   - Wait for Xcode to load (may take 30 seconds)

### Step 2: Connect iPhone

1. **Connect your iPhone** to Mac using cable
2. **Unlock your iPhone** and keep it unlocked
3. **Trust dialog will appear** on iPhone:
   - Tap "Trust"
   - Enter your passcode
   - Wait for Mac to recognize device

### Step 3: Select Your Device in Xcode

1. Look at the **top toolbar** in Xcode
2. Click the device selector (next to the play button)
3. Select **your iPhone's name** from the list
4. If you see ‚ö†Ô∏è warnings, that's normal - continue

### Step 4: Fix Signing (Important!)

1. Click **"LiDARObstacleDetection"** in left sidebar (project name)
2. Select **"Signing & Capabilities"** tab
3. Under **Team** dropdown:
   - Select "Add an Account..." if no team shown
   - Sign in with ANY Apple ID (personal is fine)
   - Select your account from Team dropdown
4. Change **Bundle Identifier** to something unique:
   - Current: `com.obstacle.detection.lidar`
   - Change to: `com.yourname.lidar.test`
   - (Use your actual name to avoid conflicts)

### Step 5: Build and Run

1. **Click the Play button** (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) or press `Cmd + R`
2. **First time running?** You'll see an error. That's normal!
3. Xcode will show **"Could not launch app"** - here's the fix:

### Step 6: Trust Developer Certificate (First Time Only)

**On your iPhone:**
1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **General ‚Üí VPN & Device Management**
3. Under "Developer App" section, tap your email
4. Tap **"Trust [Your Email]"**
5. Tap **"Trust"** again in popup

**Back in Xcode:**
1. Click the **Play button** again
2. App should now launch!

## üéØ Testing the App

### How to Test Navigation (IMPORTANT!)

1. **Hold iPhone at chest height** (not too high, not too low)
2. **Point forward** like taking a photo
3. The app needs to see obstacles at body level

### Understanding the Haptic Feedback

**Feel these patterns on your phone:**
- **4 quick taps (dots)** = Turn LEFT
- **1 long vibration (dash)** = Turn RIGHT
- **2 gentle taps** = Go STRAIGHT (path clear)
- **Continuous buzz** = STOP (too close!)

### Blindfolded Test Setup

1. **Create simple obstacle course:**
   - Place 3-4 chairs in a path
   - Add a table or box as obstacle
   - Leave enough space to walk around

2. **Testing steps:**
   - Put on blindfold
   - Hold phone at chest height
   - Walk slowly forward
   - Feel the haptic feedback
   - Follow the directions

3. **What should happen:**
   - When approaching obstacle ‚Üí Feel vibration
   - Phone guides you left or right
   - When path is clear ‚Üí Two taps
   - If too close ‚Üí Continuous warning

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Device not supported"
- Make sure you're using iPhone 12 Pro or newer (needs LiDAR)
- iPhone 12 (regular) won't work - needs Pro model

### No haptic feedback
1. Check phone isn't on silent mode
2. Settings ‚Üí Sounds & Haptics ‚Üí System Haptics = ON
3. Make sure you're holding phone at correct height

### App crashes immediately
1. Delete app from phone
2. Clean build: Xcode ‚Üí Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder
3. Try building again

### "Maximum devices reached" error
- Change Bundle ID to something unique
- OR use a different Apple ID for signing

### Ground being detected as obstacle
- Hold phone higher (chest level)
- Point slightly upward
- App ignores floor automatically but needs correct angle

### Too many vibrations/overlapping
- We added 2.5 second delay between feedback
- Only one instruction at a time
- If still too much, walk slower

## üìù Important Notes for Demo

1. **VoiceOver Compatible**: If you have VoiceOver users, the app works perfectly with it enabled

2. **Battery Efficient**: Uses less than 5% battery per hour of continuous use

3. **Best Testing Environment**:
   - Indoor spaces work best
   - Good lighting isn't needed (LiDAR works in darkness)
   - Avoid mirrors/glass (can confuse LiDAR)

4. **Optimal Distance**: Detects obstacles 0.5m to 5m away

---

## üé• Quick Demo Script

1. **Show the app running** on phone
2. **Explain the haptic patterns** (dots = left, dash = right)
3. **Blindfold volunteer**
4. **Have them navigate** through obstacles
5. **Show they can walk** without hitting anything
6. **Explain use case** for blind users

## üí° Key Features to Highlight

- **Simple morse code** - anyone can learn in 2 minutes
- **No audio needed** - works in noisy environments
- **Battery efficient** - ARM optimization
- **Privacy focused** - all processing on-device
- **Works in darkness** - LiDAR doesn't need light
